Feature: User should be able to delete articles
  As a publisher/journalist
  In order to trim content from the site
  I would like to be able to delete articles

  Background:
    Given following user exist
      | email                 | role       |
      | author@email.com      | author     |

    And the following articles exist
      | title               | body                  |
      | Holger is the best  | Dreamteam for the win |

  Scenario: User can delete an article
    Given I am logged in as 'author@email.com'
    And I am on the "Holger is the best" article page
    When I click on "Delete Article"
    Then I should see "Holger is the best has been deleted"
    And I should be on the "Index" page
